# JavaScript Selection Statements

## Getting Started

1. Open your command line and navigate to your `repos` directory (if you do not have a `repos` folder, then you can use `mkdir repos` to create one)
2. Use this template repository to start a new project in your repos folder: `git clone <repo_name>`
3. cd `repo_name` to navigate into your new repo directory
4. Start Visual Studio Code and select 'Open Folder'. Then select `repo_name` to open the folder in the editor (or just type `code .` in your terminal inside the repo directory)
5. Follow the instructions on the README.md file to complete exercises
6. Open the app.js file to get started

## Exercise 1: Ignore Even

In this exercise, you will be counting from 1 - 100. For each odd number, you will print the number to the console. If the number is even, do nothing.

1. Create a `for loop` that evaluates numbers from 1 to 100.
2. Inside the loop body, write an `if/else` selection statement that checks whether a number is odd
3. If the number is odd, then print the number to the console, otherwise do nothing and continue to the next number

```
1
3
5
...
```

## Exercise 2: FIZZBUZZ

FIZZBUZZ is a very common coding interview problem. Below are the instructions to solving the problem:

1. Create a `for loop` that evaluates numbers from 1 to 100 like the problem above.
2. Write a `if/else` selection statement inside the body of the the loop that checks the following:
   - If the number is divisible by 3, then `console.log` 'FIZZ'
   - If the number is divisible by 5, then `console.log` 'BUZZ'
   - If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, then `console.log` 'FIZZBUZZ'

Ex: 15 would print 'FIZZBUZZ', 33 would print 'FIZZ', and 35 would print 'BUZZ'
